                    <h4> Definitions </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li> With junction we mean: The controller, corresponding lights and tracks. </li>
                        <li> With safe we mean that there is no trolley on the outgoing track. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4> Assumptions about the requirements </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Requirement 2: Only the traffic lights that prevent the entry to the junction are set to red, otherwise the trolley could never leave the junction. </li>
                        <li> Requirement 3: Again only the traffic lights that prevent the entry need to be red. </li>
                        <li> Requirement 4: Under permission to pass we understand that the trolley just gets green light, it doesn't need to pass. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4> Other assumptions </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li> The state of the controller is retained after a shutdown/reboot and messages are never lost even in a shutdown scenario. </li>
                        <li> The tracefiles start and end in a default state, meaning junctions start and end empty. </li>
                        <li> The track detects the trolley and sends the signal to the controller. </li>
                        <li> Time of messages in the log are linear i.e. network delays are non-existent. </li>
                        <li> Trollies respect the traffic lights which will prevent them from entering inconsistent states. This implies there can only be a single trolley on a given track. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        In this FSM we use an informal notation we used to employ in another course.
                        * Means all valid transitions (aka <b>[GREX] [123]</b>) minus all other outgoing transitions from that state.
                        When there is no outgoing transition for a certain output it is assumed to go to a dead state.

                    <h1>Code verification</h1>

                    <p> All traces for trolley is on junction were accepted. </p>
                    <p> traces 2,3,4 and 6 for trolley priority were accepted. But this is a negative match FSA which means these files are wrong. </p>

                    <h1>Problem/bug in traces</h1>
                    <p>
                        From our observations it looks like there is no minimal timer for the light to be green.
                        If trolley 1 arrives and the junction is empty, it gets green. But if trolley 2 arrives a second later,
                        it will switch the lights. Under our assumptions this isn't a hard error but certainly could be an issue in the real world.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The intersection is empty</li>
                        <li>Trolley 1 arrives</li>
                        <li>Light 1 is set to green (as there is nobody)</li>
                        <li>Trolley 2 arrives</li>
                        <li>Light 1 is set to red and light 2 becomes green</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This is probably very confusing for the driver of the trolley.</p>

                    <p>
                        The other more serious problem is that the priority requirement is not satisfied in most files.
                        Sometimes when a trolley enters the junction, the controller gets confused and gives the wrong track green lights.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In our findings this happens in two cases: When a trolley is on the junction and two trollies are waiting or when a trolley arrives just after the trolley leaves the junction.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A sample trace for the first case is as follows:
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        E 3<br>
                        E 1<br>
                        E 2<br>
                        X 3<br>
                        G 2<br>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        We see that the second trolley that arrived gets priority. An example of this is tracefile2 line 17484.

                        The second case is:
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        E 3<br>
                        E 1<br>
                        X 3<br>
                        E 2<br>
                        G 2<br>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        This is almost the same except the reversed <b>X 3</b> and <b>E 2</b>.
                        Again the wrong trolley gets priority.

                        It's difficult to find out why these errors occurs without any code.
                        A guess could be that priority queues are not updated while there
                        is a trolley on the junction, but it could be something else altogether.
