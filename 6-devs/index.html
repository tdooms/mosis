                                    The two tracks joining at zeigler Circus first pass through a virtual junction with
                                    traverse_delay of 0 seconds, the junction and the station are connected with a track
                                    of
                                    length 0 meters.
                                </p>

                                    Capacity of the trolley over time is interpreted as amount of passengers in the
                                    trolley
                                    as the capacity of the trolley would just be a flat line.
                                </p>

                                    We don't have any special logic for passengers that have an unreachable destination,
                                    they will just wait indefinitely.

                        <h2>Part 2: Creating the network</h2>
                        <p>
                            In order to create the network we've chosen to do this via the JSON format. This is because
                            we thought this would the most light-weight format to create a flexible solution of modeling
                            the rail network. In the next paragraphs we'll discuss the format of the JSON and then the
                            code that is used to interpret this JSON. The json can be found
                            <a href="networks/city.json">here</a>.
                        </p>
                        <h4>JSON format</h4>
                        <img src="img/json/stations.png" alt=""/>
                        <p>
                            First of all we have the name stations. Its value is a list that contains the name of a
                            station, and a split. This split is a dictionary of the outgoing lines at that point. The
                            names are the line colours and the numbers are on which track they need to go. We look at
                            these outgoing lines clock-wise, starting from 10 o'clock.
                        </p>
                        <img src="img/json/junctions.png" alt=""/>
                        <p>
                            Next up we have the junctions. We have for each junction a name, an input and possibly the
                            transfer_time. The transfer time is the time that it takes to take the junction, by default
                            this is 10, so it is not specified for 2 of the 3 junctions. The third junction belongs to
                            a station.
                        </p>
                        <img src="img/json/rails.png" alt=""/>
                        <p>
                            Now, we have the rails list. This contain a list of all the possible rails in the model.
                            Each entry contains the length, the start station/junction name and the end station/junction
                            name. You can see that sometimes we define the start_port and the end_port. This needs only
                            to be done when we depart from a station and arrive in a junction, this is so we can split
                            and join properly.
                        </p>
                        <img src="img/json/lines.png" alt=""/>
                        <p>
                            Following the rails list, we have the lines. The lines are again a list. We first have the
                            name or color of the line and then all the stations that it contains.
                        </p>
                        <img src="img/json/trollies.png" alt=""/>
                        <p>
                            Lastly, we have a list of trollies. Each of these entries contain the velocity of the
                            trolley, the location at which they start and the line to which they belong.
                        </p>
                        <h4>JSON parsing</h4>
                        <p>
                            In order to read the JSON file we need the <a href="src/classes.py">classes</a> file and
                            the <a href="src/parse.py">parse</a> file to create the model. The classes file is used to
                            represent the data for each of the model elements. The parse file contains the code to parse
                            the JSON file format. We use the splat operator to turn the dicts returned by the parser
                            into arguments for the classes in order to create objects.
