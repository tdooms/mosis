                    Assumptions:
                    - The two tracks joining at zeigler Circus first pass through
                    a virtual junction with traverse_delay of 0 seconds, the junction and the
                    station are connected with a track of length 0 meters.

                    - The wrong chance for passenger was vaguely defined. We interpreted it as, 'there is a 20%'
                    chance that the destination for a passenger is regenerated at the start. This can
                    mean that maybe they read the wrong info on the boards or such.
                    This is changeable for each station separately, signifying that some stations are more confusing.
                    It is best explained by showing the code.

                    <blockquote>
                        # It's important to notice that the destination is never the same as the origin
                        available = copy.deepcopy(destinations)
                        available.remove(origin)

                        # Also notice that the 'real' destination cannot be the original one
                        original = random.choice(available)
                        available.remove(original)
