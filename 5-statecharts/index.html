                    <h4> Feedback </h4>
                    <p> We feel like we had a wrong approach because we worked about <b>14h</b> on this assignment
                        together. We were always struggling with Yakindu and their awful UI/ refactoring experience.
                        When we had a bug we were never sure if it was caused by a bug in the software or a logic error.
                        Just to give an example on which we spent several hours we had a test with two enter and exits.
                        For some reason they influenced each other as running only one worked, and running only the
                        other also worked but having them together broke everything. Furthermore debugging needed to be
                        done with active commands which was slow and painful. Lastly when moving composite states,
                        transitions would randomly disappear.
                    </p>

                    <h4> Workflow </h4>
                    <p> Now that all the courses are online again we almost had no choice but to work over Discord.
                        Basil streamed while I (Thomas) watched and tried to spot errors or give some pointers.
                        We started by making a rough outline of the system, reading everything and implementing it.
                        After having our main architecture we re-read the requirements, made tests and fine-tuned each
                        component separately. Finally, we wrote some extra tests to get the 100% transition coverage.
                    </p>

                    <h4> Architecture </h4>
                    <p> We will explain the high level architecture of our statechart without diving into the details.
                        First of, our 'main' orthogonal state has four components: requesting stops, main logic,
                        boarding logic and a helper for the approaching station event.
                    </p>

                    <p> The order of these states is important because the order for event priority is based on this.
                        We'll start by explaining the smaller parts.
                    </p>

                    <p> The transition logic in the request stop is the bit manipulation and to check whether
                        the station we are at right now cannot be re-requested if we are standing still. This is done
                        though some logic with the <i> zero speed </i> variable.
                    </p>

                    <img src="img/request.png" alt="">

                    <p> In our board-unboard we have the logic for incrementing and decrementing the passenger count
                        and free places for board and unboard respectively. We also verify for 'illegal' boards and
                        unboards meaning boarding in a full trolley and unboarding an empty trolley. As you can barely
                        see on the image, we use a double arrow for the transition.
                    </p>

                    <img src="img/boardunboard.png" alt="">

                    <p> Lastly we have our helper which just transforms the approaching station to the effective
                        station which is used throughout our system. </p>

                    <p> Our main logic is again separated in several components, the main ones being the emergency stop
                        which will check the state and act accordingly, the at station logic, closing and opening doors
                        and lastly the moving stage which will handle the departing and arriving logic.
                    </p>

                    <p> We highlight the pre-departing logic. As stated in the requirements we need to have waited 2s
                        and another stations needs to be requested. If a station is set after two seconds, we unset it
                        and go to the closing doors sequence. Otherwise, we wait until a station that is not the current
                        station is set.
                    </p>

                    <img src="img/depart.png" alt="">

                    <p> After this we go to the closing doors sequence. Here we switch between obstructed and
                        waiting, every time a person tries to board or unboard. This way we assure that we can (un)board
                        again after 1s and not have doors that close. The board unboard component sends out
                        the obstructed and handles the logic, so we can omit it here.
                    </p>

                    <img src="img/closing.png" alt="">
                    
                    <p> Going further we enter the moving sequence where we set the target, wait until it is reached
                        and slow down again if approaching a wanted station.
                    </p>

                    <img src="img/moving.png" alt="">

                    <p> Finally we have the emergency logic, were we check if a trolley is at a station or not. If not
                        we slow down and then open the doors otherwise we immediately open the doors. We can then only
                        stop the emergency if the trolley is at a standstill. </p>

                    <h4>Notes</h4>
                    <p> You have probably already noticed some extra events like internalOpenDoors.
                        These are there because Yakindu's asserts somehow handled them unexpected with them breaking our
                        system.
