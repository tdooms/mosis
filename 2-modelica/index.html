                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                    <p>
                        This report contains a lot of code snippets. These could be outdated, but the files
                        corresponding to these snippets are always up-to date and contain the latest working version.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Lotka-Volterra</h4>
                    <b> Does this system stabilize? Why (not)? How can you tell? </b>
                    <p>No, it is a cyclic system, so it will never stabilize.
                        This is easy to see in the parametric graph,
                        where it would converge(spiral inward) to a certain point if
                        it were to stabilize at some point. </p>

                    <p> However, most integrators will actually converge in practice
                        after a very long time, probably due to numerical error.
                        Here is an example of the ircsko integrator that simulated 10 000 years.</p>

                    <img src="images/lotka_convergence.png" alt="convergence">

                    <p>We also tried playing with the integration parameters and select different methods.
                        All these simulations were executed with the block diagram. </p>

                    <p>The following graphs were obtained with the Rungekutta integration method.</p>

                    <img src="images/lotka_parametric.png" alt="rungekutta">

                    <p> The following graphs are calculated with the dassl integration method.
                        The outlier is due to the start being higher for some reason and then never coming back to that
                        point. Also, it is notable that the peaks of the prey are only 15 high compared to 25 for the
                        rungekutta integration method.</p>

                    <p> Some integrators give very weird results, like SymSolvercc and Qss</p>

                    <p> These are the Lotka-Volterra charts using the text model. In order to account for the requested
                        output of the model, we used the diagram editor to achieve this more quickly. x is the prey
                        and y is the predator.
                        We will now try to alter some of these parameters.
                        We will do this by multiplying each of the parameters
                        by 10 and leaving the others unchanged. Here is the code.

                    <p>
                        We take the red graph or the x-variable as the prey and the blue graph or the y-variable as the
                        predator. In the parametric plot the x-axis is the prey and the y-axis the predator.
                    </p>

                    <p> These are the graphs with alpha = 15. We can clearly see that the frequency of the rising and
                        falling of the predator and prey has increased significantly. The peaks of both predator and
                        prey are visibly higher. The falloff in predator and prey is quick, and the spikes of the
                        prey are quite short-lived. If we take the parametric plot into account we see that only the
                        prey will closely reach zero.
                    </p>

                    <p> These are the graphs with beta = 7. Both the parametric and time quantity plot do not seem
                        periodic, but this could be because of the simulation time being too short. Nonetheless, we can
                        still see that the maximum attained values for both predators and preys will probably not exceed
                        the initial values of 10 by much. The population of the predators also decreases slower than
                        the population of the prey, which drop 'instantly'.
                    </p>

                    <p> These are the graphs with delta = 2. Here again we can see that there is a period, but it looks
                        quite large as if it were the same as the parameter beta. On the other hand we have the
                        preys who have
                        significantly smaller population than the predators. Compared to the initial graph of
                        the Lotka-Volterra equations we can see that the predators are more numerous.
                        Lastly we can also notice that the population also almost flat-lines between cycles.</p>

                    <p> These are the graphs with gamma = 2. The frequency has risen significantly when increasing this
                        parameter, therefore the population will rise and fall quicker than with a lower gamma. The
                        predator population never exceeds 10, which is in stark contrast with the preys which achieve
                        numbers of up to 40. None of the populations will reach or come close to 0 in the displayed
                        curves.

                    <p>
                        We can conclude that both parameters, delta and beta, decrease the cycle of the population
                        quicker
                        than the other two parameters, alpha and gamma. While beta doesn't seem to adapt the population
                        totals, parameters alpha and delta seem to increase the population of the predators and only
                        beta seems to increase the population of the preys.

                    <p>
                        For this part the goal was to convert the equations we received into a plant, which had
                        $F_{traction}$ as input parameter. There were 2 output parameters we should take into account
                        for the plant model. These are the $v_{trolley}$ and $x_{psgr}$. Alongside these models we have
                        some parameters that are fixed during the simulations, but can be adjusted as they are
                        parameters defined as non-fixed in the model.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First we will discuss the input parameter $F_{traction}$ in how this is modeled and made
                        accessible through an interface in OMEdit. We've done this through the icon (which allows us to
                        change the look of a custom model block) and diagram view (which contains the internal
                        circuitry). The same has been done for $v_{trolley}$ and $x_{psgr}$. For the parameters, we used
                        the text editor in OMEdit. The only thing we needed to change was to put the keyword parameter
                        before the variable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The last part was creating the equations in the OMEdit tool. We did this in the text mode since
                        it was simpler than creating a whole circuit which would be probably overly complicated. [insert
                        explanation of the equations]

                        For this part we used the diagram tool, and modified the previous input and output ports of the
                        plant,
                        bangBangController and lookUp. In order to make them compatible with the circuit. Making this

                        graphical way, would make replacing and fixing individual blocks of the circuit much quicker.
                        The
                        PRT system is designed in the exact same way as shown in the task.

                        So the value will always oscillate within this range. On the second image we can see if we set
                        the max to zero,
                        the function oscillates only under the target function.

                    <p> A when will only execute the code the moment the event becomes active,

                        Using the if method, each iteration we set active to true or false
                        while using when we only set active once each time a threshold is exceeded.

                        The second image is added for completeness. Showing the ideal and actual velocity. </p>

                    <h4>Task 7 & 8: Optimize parameters & report</h4>
                    <p>To find the optimal value we opted for an automated approach. For this we had to figure out two
                        things:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The cost/evaluation function.</li>
                        <li>A way to find the minimum given this function.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>As a cost function we used a simple least squares method on the speed difference
                        with a check to reject samples where people fell.
                        Which can be seen in the method below.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        def least_squares_speed(rows) -> Optional[float]:<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;accumulator = 0<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;for row in rows:<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x_psgr = float(row['customPlant.x_psgr'])<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v_trolley = float(row['customPlant.v_trolley'])<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v_ideal = float(row['lookUp.v_ideal'])<br>
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if abs(x_psgr) > 0.35:<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return None<br>

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;return accumulator<br>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>We also considered alternate cost functions,
                        which maybe also minimize x_psgr but we decided against
                        it because it would most likely make the trolley a lot slower.</p>

                    <p>To find the minimum we opted to implement a simple hill-climber.
                        To avoid getting stuck in local minima we use multiple starting positions.
                        The hill climb function looks like this.</p>

                        This elementary hill climber will check it's direct neighbours
                        (in all 3 directions, so 6 evaluations) with an offset of c_step
                        when none of its neighbours have a lower value
                        (probably indicating that it is close to a local minimum) it will decrease its step size
                        further.
                        The algorithm halts when a certain lower bound on the step size is reached meaning we have
                        enough accuracy.
                    </p>

                    <p>This algorithm is not smart in any way and will obviously miss a lot of details.
                        We used this simple approach to get an estimate, to get better results and better performance
                        more complex algorithms should be used.</p>

                    <p>We then ran this function 100 times with random starting positions within the given range.
                        This gave us the following optimal parameters.</p>

                    <p>Which gives a cost/value of 1707.4864946354312. The graph for these values looks like this.</p>

                    <p>On the first section we see that the ideal speed is approached very nicely.
                        And on the second and third change it quickly accelerates and decelerates.</p>

                    <p>The highest value for x_psgr is on the first change, it is exactly 0.349977.
                        In a real environment one would obviously add some safety margin as to avoid people falling.</p>

                    <p>It is important to note that this is using the dassl integrator.
                        We also had to remove negative values from the range of $K_d$ as it made some assertion fail
