                        <h2> Task 1: Missing implementations </h2>
                        All the implementations for the different blocks are listed below, but also in the
                        <var>CBD.lib.std</var> module. We explain each block written here right below the code for the
                        block.
                        <blockquote>
                            signal = self.getInputSignal(curIteration)<br>

                        </blockquote>
                        NegatorBlock: This will take the current input signal and makes it negative.
                        <div class="block"></div>
                        <blockquote>

                        </blockquote>
                        InverterBlock: This will invert the current input signal and output that.
                        <div class="block"></div>
                        <blockquote>

                        </blockquote>
                        AdderBlock: This will add 2 different input signals, we didn't account for more than 2 input
                        signals, as the tests didn't fail. We've also never had the need to use more than 2 inputs.

                        </blockquote>
                        ProductBlock: This will multiply 2 different input signals. We don't multiply more than 2
                        signals, for the same reason as the AdderBlock.

                        </blockquote>
                        ModuloBlock: We take the first input signal and decide what value it should be when taking it
                        modulo the second input signal.
                        <div class="block"></div>

                        </blockquote>
                        RootBlock: This will take the signal2 root of the first input signal.
                        <div class="block"></div>

                        </blockquote>
                        PowerBlock: This block takes both signals and takes the first input signal as the base and the
                        second as the exponent.
                        <div class="block"></div>

                        GenericBlock: This will take one input signal and put the blockoperators result as a function on

                        MaxBlock: This will channel the max valued signal to the output. Again we only have 2 input

                        MinBlock: This will channel the min valued signal to the output. Again we only have 2 input

                        DelayBlock: At last, we implemented the DelayBlock. This block just returns the signal of the
                        previous
                        iteration. In iteration 0 it will return the value of the IC input port.

                            The code for the <var>__isLinear</var> method can be found in
                            <var>CBD.solver.LinearSolver</var> and is written down below. We divided the blocks into 2
                            types. The <var>LINEAR_BLOCKS</var> determined if a block would is allowed for a linear
                            equation if so then we can continue to check the other blocks in the strongly connected
                            component (scc). The other type was <var>NON_LINEAR_BLOCKS</var>. This type is all the
                            blocks which would make the scc a non-linear equation.

                            of the incoming blocks is also in the strong component, then this entire equation can't be

                        <h4>Derivator block</h4>
                        <p>
                            When we aren't in iteration 0, we use the formula for calculating the derivative in a point
                            with delta_t. Just as the limit definition states. This happens by the bottom part of the
                            block, without the top 3 blocks. These top 3 blocks are used to get the IC value as output
                            on iteration 0. Because we do not have 2 function values yet.
                        </p>

                        <h4> Backward Euler </h4>
                        <p>
                            In order to perform the backward euler rule, we initially take the IC as output, we do this
                            by summing the IC with 0. Because this is the backward euler rule, we always need to take
                            the previous function value and multiply it with the current delta_t to retrieve the
                            estimated integral for a delta_t interval at that function value. We get this value from the
                            first delay block, which generates the previous function-value as output.
                        </p>

                        <div class="block"></div>
                        <h4> Simpson integrator </h4>

                        <p> This is the most complicated integrator block of all,
                            we will start with explaining the Simpson block.
                            It is important to notice that this is an incomplete standalone block,
                            meaning it generates wrong outputs for iteration 0 and 1.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The logic itself is quite simply starting with a chain of 2 delay blocks representing
                            F(a), F((b - a) / 2) and F(b), the middle factor is
                            then multiplied by 4 and the whole thing is divided by 6 as the formula dictates.
                        </p>
                        <p>One interesting detail is the other delay block,
                            our first thought was to be smart about it and not
                            just multiply delta_t by 2 for the interval, but then we
                            realised the formula won't work for dynamic delta_t.
                            We decided to leave it in, because that way it can more
                            easily be checked if that precondition is satisfied.
                        </p>


                        <p> The root then contains the logic for deciding
                            which integration method should be used and/or accumulated to the total result.
                            The bottom part just calculates both integrals,
                            the top part then computes whether there is an even or odd amount of points.
                            Based on that we multiplex trapezoid on even and simpson on odd points.
                            The exception is on step 1 where we just return IC.
                        </p>

                        <p> The right part contains logic about 'forgetting' the trapezoid calculation.
                            We can see that sometimes the delay block is set equal to the sum,
                            or the output of itself based on the amount of points. </p>

                        <h4>Building the system</h4>
                        <p> The PIDBlock is just a simple implementation of a PID controller,
                            the block consists of the derivation, integral and proportional component,
                            multiplied by their respective parameter and summed together at the end.</p>

                        <p> The plant block is a little more complicated due to all the parameters.
                            These are all multiplied or divided or negated when necessary.
                            The most important part is the loop back into the integral.
                        </p>

                        <p> The lookup is just a simple mutliplex chain based on the time.</p>

                        <p>The root block ties everything together
                            in the same way as the previous assignment.

                        <h2> Experimenting with constant delta_t </h2>
                        <p> These experiments are done using the forward Euler method. </p>

                        <p>We start by picking a standard delta_t and see the results we would expect.</p>
                        <img src="images/delta0_3.png" alt="">

                        <div class="block"></div>


                        <p> Using very small delta's does not result in noticeable changes. </p>
                        <img src="images/delta0_01.png" alt="">

                        <div class="block"></div>


                        <p> When going up in delta we see the velocity getting quite erratic.</p>
                        <img src="images/delta5.png" alt="">

                        <div class="block"></div>


                        <p> At very high delta's the behaviour gets very chaotic oscillating dramatically around the
                            lookup
                            speed.</p>
                        <p> We also notice that the lookup table is getting very weird as the lines are not vertical
                            anymore. </p>

                        <p> Even higher delta's do cause numerical instability causing the graph to spiral out of
                            control </p>

                        <p> When changing the integration method, we don't see any noticeable differences.
                            The order is, backward Euler, Simpson and Trapezoid.

                        <h2> Task 7: Runge-Kutta </h2>
                        <p> We already showed that making delta smaller doesn't really change the graph after a certain
                            point.
                            To be very sure though we ran a last experiment on a subset of the time frame using a tiny
                            delta
                            and a small delta.
                            The first image is using delta_t = 0.001 and the second is using 0.1
                        </p>

                        <img src="images/small_delta0_001.png" alt="">
                        delta_t = 0.001

                        <div class="block"></div>

                        <img src="images/small_delta0_1.png" alt="">
                        delta_t = 0.1

                        <div class="block"></div>


                        <p> Again we see no noticeable difference. One important detail of using adaptive step size is
                            computation cost.
                            Being smart about this variable can cut simulation costs by orders of magnitude in many
                            cases.

                            along with some modifications in the CBD/lib/std.py and CBD/solver.py. We also added
                            integrator.py for additional implementations of the integrator block. The models that we
                            used can also be found in the std.py file.
                        </p>

                        <p> The convert folder contains the draw.io -> python library that was given to us.
                            All our draw.io files can be found there.
                        </p>

                        <p> Lastly, the image folder contains all the images found in the report. </p>
