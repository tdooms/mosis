                    <h2> Railroad system </h2>

                    <p>To construct the railroad in TAPAAL we first have to understand how the tracks are laid out,
                        How we understand it is depicted in this image.</p>

                    <img src="images/tracks.png" alt="">

                    <p>The next step is to define our tracks as states and our trolleys as tokens,
                        the transitions would indicate where the trolley can go to.</p>

                    <p> The lights can be modelled as two oscillating states,
                        every step this transition then needs to be fired.
                        We can then use this token as an input of the transition to the track with the light.
                        We then need to return this token of course to keep the light going. </p>


                    <h4> Insert image here </h4>
                    <h2> Traces </h2>
                    <p>We can also generate interesting traces with our model.
                        One of them is a trolley traveling for at least 2 tracks before passing through
                        a light that is red when the trolley arrives there. Here is the trace and the initial setup. </p>

                    <img src="images/2track_red.png" alt="">
                    <img src="images/2track_red_initial.png" alt="">

                    <p> Another trace is for a trolley that travels in a single "8"-shape over the network,
                        without ever seeing a red light. Again here are the traces and initial setups.</p>

                    <img src="images/full8.png" alt="">
                    <img src="images/full8_initial.png" alt="">

                    <h2> Reachability/Coverability </h2>

                    <p>
                        The reachability graph for this model will be finite as there are a finite amount of valid states.
                        There are a finite amount of states and there are either 0 or 1 tokens in a state.
                        We can in fact calculate an upper bound which is 2^n with n being the number of states.
                    </p>
