                    <h2> Railroad system </h2>

                    <p>To construct the railroad in TAPAAL we first have to understand how the tracks are laid out,
                        How we understand it is depicted in this image.</p>

                    <img src="images/tracks.png" alt="">

                    <p>The next step is to define our tracks as states and our trolleys as tokens,
                        the transitions would indicate where the trolley can go to.</p>

                    <p> The lights can be modelled as two oscillating states,
                        every step this transition then needs to be fired.
                        We can then use this token as an input of the transition to the track with the light.
                        We then need to return this token of course to keep the light going. </p>


                    <h4> Insert image here </h4>
                    <h2> Traces </h2>
                    <p>We can also generate interesting traces with our model.
                        One of them is a trolley traveling for at least 2 tracks before passing through
                        a light that is red when the trolley arrives there. Here is the trace and the initial setup. </p>

                    <img src="images/2track_red.png" alt="">
                    <img src="images/2track_red_initial.png" alt="">

                    <p> Another trace is for a trolley that travels in a single "8"-shape over the network,
                        without ever seeing a red light. Again here are the traces and initial setups.</p>

                    <img src="images/full8.png" alt="">
                    <img src="images/full8_initial.png" alt="">

                    <h2> Reachability/Coverability </h2>

                    <p>
                        The reachability graph for this model will be finite as there are a finite amount of valid states.
                        There are a finite amount of states and there are either 0 or 1 tokens in a state.
                        We can in fact calculate an upper bound which is 2^n with n being the number of states.
                    </p>

                    <p> Below are, respectively, the reachability and coverability graphs.
                        Both are finite as expected.
                        The first pair is generated from a setup where no trolley is present.
                        We can see the clock token going around and the light switching at the end of this sequence.
                        After two lights have changed we return to the original. </p>

                    <p> We can also notice that the reachability and coverability graph are identical.
                        This is due to the fact that the amount of tokens is bounded (by 1).
                        Because of this we will omit the coverability graph. </p>

                    <img src="images/reachability.svg" alt="">

                    <p> We can also simulate two trolleys, starting on S1 and S6
                        Here the graph is not cyclic because we encounter a deadlock,
                        we will probably discuss this setup more in a later exercise.
                    </p>

                    <img src="images/reachability_s1s6.svg" alt="">

                    <p> To make this graph infinite we could add one or more transitions to
                        'duplicate' trolleys. This would cause the amount of trolleys on each
                        track to increase by one every lap, thus never returning to the same state.
                        This of course violates the constraint that every track can only hold a single trolley.
                    </p>

                    <h2> File structure </h2>
                    <p> The images generated for this assignment can be found in the image folder.
                        Next the models contain the TAPAAL files, the first model is without a
                        clock and the second one with one. Lastly the generated dot files by the
                        python script can be found in the dot folder.
